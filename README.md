## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to test your project locally:

1. **Start the replica**:
   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

2. **Deploy canisters**:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

   Your application will then be accessible at:
   ```
   http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}
   ```

3. **Generate the Candid interface** (if backend changes occur):
   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```

4. **Start the frontend development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Access the frontend at `http://localhost:8080`.

- **Title & Description**: Key details about the job.
- **Salary**: Offered payment.

### Payment
Details of escrow payments, including:
- **Client & Freelancer IDs**: Identifies involved parties.

## üíÉ Data Storage
The project uses `HashMap` for efficient data storage:
- **Users**: Store registered users and roles.
- **Jobs**: Manage job postings and applications.
- **Escrows**: Handle payment transactions.
- **Disputes**: Track conflict cases.

## üìù Notes
- **Frontend Variables**: Configure `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` or manage `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` manually.
- **Environment Variables**: `Env.mo` added to `.gitignore`. Create new `Env.mo` and define custom module for admin and canisters ID variables. E.g `module{public let admin = "aaaaa-aa"}`
