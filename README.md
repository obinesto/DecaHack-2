# `DecaHack2`

Welcome to your new `DecaHack2` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `DecaHack2`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd DecaHack2/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

# About API
  `The Motoko code defines an actor named Marketplace that serves as a backend/API for a freelancing platform. This actor manages users, jobs, payments, and disputes. The code begins by importing several modules from the Motoko base library, such as Principal, HashMap, Buffer, and others, which provide essential functionalities for the actor.`

  `The Marketplace actor defines several types to represent users, roles, payments, applications, jobs, statuses, evidence, and disputes. For instance, the User type includes fields for username, hashedPassword, and role, while the Job type includes title, description, and salary. The actor maintains several HashMap instances to store users, username-to-principal mappings, disputes, payments, jobs, and applications. These maps are used to efficiently manage and retrieve data.`

  `The Marketplace actor includes various functions to handle user-related operations. The init function initializes a secret for hashing passwords. The isLoggedIn function checks if a user is logged in, while getUserRole retrieves the role of a user. The registerUser function registers a new user, ensuring that the user ID and username are unique. The hashPassword function hashes a given password using a secret. The generatePrincipalFromUsername function generates a principal from a username by hashing it. The signup function allows a new user to sign up, and the login function handles user login by validating credentials. The actor also includes functions for managing jobs. The postJob function allows a client to post a job, while getJob retrieves a job by client ID. The deleteJob function deletes a job by client ID. Additionally, the applyForJob function allows a freelancer to apply for a job, and getApplications retrieves job applications by freelancer ID.`

  `For payment management, the createEscrow function creates an escrow payment between a client and a freelancer. The releasePayment function releases a payment to the freelancer.`

  `The actor also handles dispute resolution. The initiateDispute function initiates a dispute between a client and a freelancer. The submitEvidence function allows submitting evidence for a dispute. The changeDisputeStatus function changes the status of a dispute. The getDispute function retrieves dispute details, while resolveDispute resolves a dispute with a given decision. The getDisputeStatus function retrieves the status of a dispute, and listAllDisputes lists all disputes with their details.`

# Env.mo added to gitignore. Create custom env.mo for hash functionality
