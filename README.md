# `DecaHack2`

Welcome to your new `DecaHack2` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `DecaHack2`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd DecaHack2/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

# Marketplace Actor

This project implements a decentralized marketplace system using the Motoko programming language. The `Marketplace` actor provides functionalities for user management, job postings, escrow payments, and dispute resolution.

## Imports

The project imports several modules from the Motoko base library:

- `Principal`: Handles principal identities.
- `HashMap`: Provides hash map data structures.
- `Buffer`: Provides buffer data structures.
- `Option`: Handles optional values.
- `Array`: Provides array data structures.
- `Iter`: Provides iteration utilities.
- `Text`: Handles text manipulation.
- `Env`: Accesses environment variables.
- `Debug`: Provides debugging utilities.
- `Char`: Handles character manipulation.
- `Result`: Handles result types.
- `Error`: Handles error types.
- `Time`: Manages time-related functionalities.

## Actor Definition

The `Marketplace` actor encapsulates all the functionalities of the marketplace.

### Admin Principal

The admin principal is defined using an environment variable

## Types and Data Structures

Several types are defined to represent different entities within the marketplace

### User

Represents a user with a username, hashed password, and role

### Role

An enumeration for user roles

### Payment

Represents a payment with client and freelancer IDs, amount, and status

### Application

Represents a job application with a job ID and cover letter

### Job

Represents a job with a title, description, and salary

### Status

An enumeration for various statuses

### Evidence

Represents evidence in a dispute with a description and optional file link

### Dispute

Represents a dispute with client and freelancer IDs, reason, evidence, and status

### ImmutableDispute

A version of `Dispute` with immutable arrays for evidence and status

## Data Storage

The actor maintains several `HashMap` data structures to store users, username-to-Principal mappings, disputes, payments, sessions, jobs, and job applications.

## User Management

The actor includes functions for user management:

- `isAdmin`: Checks if the caller is the admin.
- `isLoggedIn`: Checks if a user is logged in based on session time.
- `getUserRole`: Retrieves the role of a user.
- `registerUser`: Registers a new user.
- `hashPassword`: Hashes a user's password.
- `signup`: Signs up a new user.
- `login`: Logs in a user.
- `validateCredentials`: Validates user credentials.
- `getUsers`: Retrieves all users (admin only).
- `logout`: Logs out a user.
- `deleteUser`: Deletes a user (admin only).

## Job Management

The actor includes functions for job management:

- `postJob`: Posts a new job.
- `getJob`: Retrieves a job by client ID.
- `deleteJob`: Deletes a job (admin only).

## Job Applications

The actor includes functions for job applications:

- `applyForJob`: Applies for a job.
- `getApplications`: Retrieves job applications for a freelancer.

## Escrow Payments

The actor includes functions for managing escrow payments:

- `createEscrow`: Creates a new escrow payment.
- `releasePayment`: Releases a payment (admin only).

## Dispute Resolution

The actor includes functions for dispute resolution:

- `initiateDispute`: Initiates a new dispute.
- `submitEvidence`: Submits evidence for a dispute.
- `changeDisputeStatus`: Changes the status of a dispute (admin only).
- `getDispute`: Retrieves a dispute by client ID.
- `resolveDispute`: Resolves a dispute (admin only).
- `getDisputeStatus`: Retrieves the status of a dispute.
- `listAllDisputes`: Lists all disputes (admin only).

## Summary

The `Marketplace` actor provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for managing users, jobs, payments, and disputes in a decentralized marketplace. It leverages various data structures and modules from the Motoko base library to implement these features efficiently.
